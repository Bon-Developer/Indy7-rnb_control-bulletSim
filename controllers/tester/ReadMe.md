# Instruction for controller tester
* This project is a tool for debugging programming errors in new controllers.
* **[NOTE]** This is only for debugging and no plant is implemented - q and q_n are simply generated by low-pass-filter

# Run testing

## 0. Make your own controller to be tested
* Follow steps on main ReadMe.md file

## 1. Load your controller to this tester
* 1.1 locate ***tester/CMakeLists.txt*** and add your controller .cpp file as a source, as shown below
```cmake
add_executable(${PROJECT_NAME} test_controller.cpp ../PD/PD.cpp)
```
* 1.2 Apply youre controller in **main()** of ***tester/test_controller.cpp***
```cpp
ControlAlgorithmPD contoller(ControllerInterface::ControlMode::JOINT_CONTROL, JOINT_DOF, TASK_DOF, DT);
```

## 2. Compile and run the tester
```bash
cd tester
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
&& make \
&& ./TEST_CONTROLLER
```

## 3. Check the output
* You can find the result files on ***tester/test_dat***

# Debug your controllers
* Apply your controller as instructed in **Run testing** and use debug tools like **clion**
* It is recommended to use this project from the beginning when you are implementing a new controller.
* Just keep in mind that you should *RESET THE CODE* to the original form before merging with other branch, to avoid conflicts.
